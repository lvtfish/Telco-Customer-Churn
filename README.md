## Telco Customer Churn Classification with Machine Learning
Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) based on a dataset of customer behavior. The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information on a sample of customers from a telecommunications company.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries installed on your computer:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
Data Preparation
The first step in building a machine learning model is to prepare the data. This involves loading the data into a pandas DataFrame, cleaning and transforming the data as necessary, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Selection
Once the data has been prepared, the next step is to choose a machine learning model to use. In this project, we will use several different models and compare their performance in order to choose the best model for our needs. The models we will use include:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Model Evaluation
Once the model has been selected, it is important to evaluate its performance to see how well it is able to predict customer churn. This can be done by using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model with the best performance will be used to make predictions on the testing data.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that could predict customer churn based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. By preparing the data, selecting the best model, and evaluating its performance, we were able to achieve this goal. This model can be used by the telecommunications company to predict which customers are likely to churn, and to take actions to retain these customers and prevent them from leaving.
